# Moodle Plugin "sync_service"
This plugin for Moodle (type: local) adds serveral functions to the Moodle Web Service API.
Those fuctions allow users and external services to remotely create and move new course modules.
Furthermore an external service (called "Course Sync Extension Service") containing the newly added functions and other core web service functions, which are helpful to use the added functions, is added.

The plugin is developed to work with the desktop application [MoodleSync](https://github.com/lectureStudio/MoodleSync), used for file synchronization between a local directory and the learning platform Moodle.

Following functions are added:
Function | Description | Note
-------- | -------- | --------
local_course_add_new_course_module_url |Add course module URL |
local_course_add_new_course_module_resource | Add course module Resource | File needs to be uploaded with "/webservice/upload.php" web service call.
local_course_add_new_course_module_directory | Add course modul Folder | Files need to be uploaded with "/webservice/upload.php" web service call.
local_course_add_files_to_directory | Add files to folder | Work in progress - not working yet
local_course_move_module_to_specific_position | Move a module to a dedicated position |

Usage:  
* Tested on Moodle version 3.11.4. and 4.0.2. 
* Usage of the "REST (returning JSON)"- web service protocol.
* To install the plugin, unzip the archive and copy the folder "sync_service" into the directory "\server\moodle\local". Afterwards restart Moodle, log-in as an admin and follow the installation process.
* To use the added fuctions, either enable and use the added external service (file upload and file download must be allowed) or create a new external service.
